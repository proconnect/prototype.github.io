								A dogʼs aggressive behaviour is esculated when we donʼt recognise an expression from a warning signal. Dogs explore the world by sound and smell, and communicate that world through their facial expression, body language and posture. For our safety, we must understand their body language and what motivates them to act out.

				<div id="nose" class="tabcontent">
				<p>NOSE: A dog interprets the world predominately by smell while humans use sight and sound. Dogs can tell time with their nose. e.g. a strong scent signals a new/free smell while a faint smell signifies age. also through the nose, they can sense how we are feeling emotionally</p>
				</div>

				<div id="eyes" class="tabcontent">
				<p>EYES: Dogs use direct eye contact to communicate a threat. A dogʼs direct
				gaze can either be threatening or friendly while an intense stare indicates the dog is feeling aggressive. Slowly look away from this dog. By doing so you are speaking their language; it is what other dogs would do to communicate they are not a threat</p>				
				</div>

				<div id="head" class="tabcontent">
				<p>HEAD: Dogs that challenge authority are dogs that try to prove their alpha dog status through aggression. "Territorial Aggression" is triggered by a threat to what the dog perceives as his territory: his home and possibly the area surrounding it. "Protective Aggression" is motivated by a desire to keep his pack - including his people family and other animals safe. "Possessive Aggression" may result when the dog feels something that he views as his - toys, food or sleeping area maybe taken from him. "Redirected Aggression" is behaviour that is directed not at the person or animal the dog fears, but to someone else because of proximity or opportunity. Movement - a squirrel or cat that is on the move, a jogger, bicycle or car, for example - usually triggers "Predatory Aggression". Fearful PUPS are more likely to develop aggressive behaviour, especially in stressful situations, while a dog that has been exposed to different sights, sounds, and a variety of experiences, people and animals is generally a well-adjusted dog.</p>				
				</div>

				<div id="ears" class="tabcontent">
				<p>EARS: Dogs communicate more with their ears than others. Raised ears and
				pointed forward indicate alert that something gets the dogʼs attention. A submissive dog has ears that either stick out the sides of itʼs head or ears that are completely flattened, it depends on the breed. Ears that are held naturally are a sign that the dog feels relaxed.</p>
				</div>

				<div id="mouth" class="tabcontent">
				<p>MOUTH: Dogs vocalise their emotions just like we do but predominately. An
				exaggerated YAWN is often used to release tension and could be a signal that the dog feels intimidated. When the lips are pulled back and up to expose teeth. Less easily understood is the GRIN which, because the teeth are exposed and the lips are turned up, can be confused with an aggressive look, but communicate that the dog is feeling very submissive. Dogs also show submissiveness with a closed mouth, or by licking the person or animal they are interacting with. A yawn may not mean that the dog is tired, it is a canine signal used to placate a threat. An aggressive dog is using his teeth to intimidate; a submissive dog is saying the exact opposite by signalling that he is not a threat and wonʼt cause any problems. GROWLING is the language of aggression.</p>
				</div>

				<div id="tail" class="tabcontent">
				<p>TAIL: A relaxed dog holds his tail naturally while a dog on alert holds his tail stiff and higher than normal. A threatening dog may give warning by moving a stiff tail that is held high back and forth, known as “flagging” his tail. THE INTENSITY ACCOMPANIED BY THE ACTION IS KEY. A wagging tail held intensely is a potential threat, while a gently wagging tail is friendly. Breed must also be taken into consideration. A tail tucked between the rear legs can often indicate submissiveness. HOWEVER BREEDS LIKE THE WHIPPET HAVE TAILS THAT DO THIS NATURALLY. Dogs with shorter tails canʼt always make their feelings known as forcibly as dogs with longer and more expressive tails.</p>
				</div>

				<div id="body" class="tabcontent">
				<p>BODY: Their bodies give off warning signals before they bite, for example direct eye contact communicates a threat and insight into this intensive behaviour will help people know when to avoid a potential threat that might otherwise be excessive or life threatening. The details are found in body movement. The way they stare with intensity, the raised sti ff tail, neck arched forward with teeth exposed followed by a distinctive growl are definite signs of aggressive behaviour. At this point their posture tells all with teeth snapping, they stand tall to indicate itʼs dominance over you</p>
